### Rendering Patterns 
- Server-side rendering: In this pattern, the server generates the HTML for a page and sends it to the client's browser. This allows for faster initial page load times, but can result in slower subsequent interactions.

- Client-side rendering: In this pattern, the initial HTML for a page is sent from the server, but subsequent updates to the page are handled by the client's browser. This allows for faster interactions, but can result in slower initial page load times.

- Isomorphic rendering: In this pattern, the same code is used to generate the initial HTML on the server and to handle subsequent updates on the client's browser. This allows for a balance of faster initial page load times and faster subsequent interactions.

- Static rendering: In this pattern, the entire HTML for a page is generated at build time and is served as a static file. This allows for the fastest initial page load times, but does not allow for any dynamic updates to the page.

- Progressive rendering: In this pattern, the initial HTML for a page is sent from the server, but only a portion of the page is initially rendered. Subsequent updates to the page are then progressively rendered as needed. This allows for faster initial page load times and faster subsequent interactions.
